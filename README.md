**`Software Engineering Student`**

I'm a Computer Science student from Costa Rica trying to get enough knowledge to build my way up to be a Full Stack Developer.
Currently I'm finishing my first year of degree in ULACIT. I've been working in little projects due to different courses that I've complete, but for me its not enough with the projects that I did, so I'm looking for some new areas to experiment and practice my programming skills so I can achive my goal.
